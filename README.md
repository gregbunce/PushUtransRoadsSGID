The purpose of this tool is automate many tasks that are involved in geodatabase maintenance (delete non-coincident duplicate vertices (vertices within a specified distance), convert null to empty, spatially assign attributes based on polygon data, etc.). 

This project creates an installable ArcMap toolbar containg a few tools.

The tools in this repo are designed for ArcMap 10.7.x and built with the ArcObjects SDK 10.7.x using C#.Net.

This project also requires the .NET setup project (VS Installer package) to create the installation files (.msi).
