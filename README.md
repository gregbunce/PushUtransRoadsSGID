The purpose of this tool is automate many tasks that are involved in geodatabase maintenance (delete non-coincident duplicate vertices (vertices within a specified distance), convert null to empty, spatially assign attributes based on polygon data, etc.). These tools are used during a road and trails update.

This project creates an installable ArcMap toolbar containing a few tools including: split line, convert nulls to blanks, spatially assign fields from sgid polygon data, etc.

The tools in this repo are designed for ArcMap 10.7.x and built with the ArcObjects SDK 10.7.x using C#.Net.

This project also requires the .NET setup project (VS Installer package) to create the installation files (.msi).
